# Bidirectional LSTM model
Note:
- The LSTM model would not have a good performance on the short text since the limited data are not enough to catch the syntax
- Currently the timestep is char by char

Problem unsolved: 
- How to randomise the pictures without changing the sequence of the text line inside
- How to generate and store the data more efficiently
- Only char-by-char information is catched, but no word-by-word
